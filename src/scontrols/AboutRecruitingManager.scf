<p>
Recruiting Manager for AppExchange offers a structured, consolidated way to track and manage the recruiting process, so organizations have easy access to information about openings, applicants, candidates, and hiring goals. 
</p>
<p>
Recruiting Manager helps you zero in on the talent you need to run your business without wasting valuable time keeping track of recruiting details. The application allows you to extend your salesforce.com solution to create a single repository of the information you need about each would-be employee. You can even segment early-stage applicants from more promising late-stage candidates to identify who’s moving forward and which positions are likely to be filled soon. 
</p>
<p>
On the Jobs tab you can see the basics about each open position, including it’s current status and how long it’s been open. Some of your best candidates may be referred by your current employees. So Recruiting Manager lets you easily track referrals in case you want to say “thank you” or provide more formal employee incentives. 
</p>
<p>Designed for companies with fairly complex hiring needs, Recruiting Manager enables you to get quick answers to questions like “How many positions have been filled this month?” and “How many candidates are there for current openings?” If you’re interested in comparing this with a more basic application designed to help small and medium-sized companies with recruiting, take a look at Recruiting.

<h2 class="exchangeTitle">The AppExchange</h2>
<p>
The AppExchange is the world’s first on-demand application-sharing service. The dozens of pre-built applications and components it offers have 
been created by salesforce.com customers, developers, and partners. With these 
apps, users can do everything from managing expenses to tracking purchasing to 
monitoring recruiting. Companies can browse, test drive, and install these apps 
into their salesforce.com accounts with a single click.</p></font>
<p>Using the AppExchange, organizations can easily add new apps to their 
current salesforce.com deployments, run them alongside their existing on-demand 
applications, and easily customize them to meet their unique needs. The breadth 
of applications on the AppExchange — including CRM and many other types of 
business apps — is limited only by the imagination of its publishers and the 
on-demand community itself. </p></font>
